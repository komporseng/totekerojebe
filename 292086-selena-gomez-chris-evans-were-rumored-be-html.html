They even used one of Taylor Swift's TikTok posts. But are Evans and Gomez dating? Is "Chelena" really happening? Read on to find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/73ab62e491739517b413b1a2445be95e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Chris Evans on March 13, 2014 in Hollywood, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HINT #1: "ISN'T HE CUTE?"</strong></p><p class=dh>One of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/707771/selena-gomez-has-a-crush-on-chris-evans-addresses-alleged-drama-involving-taylor-swift-and-demi-lovato-watch>first indicators</a> Gomez and Evans's fans got about a possible romance between them happened in October 2015 when the "Wizards of Waverly Place" alum was 23, and the "Captain America" actor was 34.</p><p class=dh>During Gomez's appearance on "Watch What Happens Live," a caller asked if she had a celebrity crush, and she revealed she "kind of" had a crush on Evans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/40e52fafa550b0ab458ff1f8c4d2813e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Selena Gomez on April 11, 2018 in Culver City, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>"Isn't he cute?" Gomez asked host Andy Cohen. He told her that Evans's brother, Scott, had been bartending on the show a week earlier. Gomez was shocked and joked that maybe their relationship was meant to be.</p><p class=dh>Fellow guest Willie Geist asked if she had previously talked about her crush on Evans in public, and Gomez answered, "no." Geist pointed out that her words were out in the universe already, but the singer was worried.</p><p class=dh>Gomez was sure that Evans would either hate her or love her for her revelation, but Cohen and Geist assured her he would be okay with it.</p><p class=dh>Cohen also asked the "Lose You to Love Me" singer if Nick Jonas was gay because he played gay characters in "Kingdom" and "Scream Queens." Gomez pointed out that she dated Jonas, so he was not gay. Jonas married supermodel Priyanka Chopra.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HINT #2: INSTAGRAM SNITCHED ON CHRIS EVANS</strong></p><p class=dh>Evans and Gomez's dating rumors made headlines again in early October 2021 after eagle-eyed fans noticed that Evans started <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/chrisevans/following/>following Gomez</a> on Instagram.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>"Chelena" theorists found [Gomez's] sweater very similar to the one Evans wore in the 2019 film "Knives Out."</strong></h3><p class=dh>Most people might think it was not the clearest indicator of their alleged romance, but he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/a37925745/selena-gomez-chris-evans-dating/>followed only</a> 162 people on Instagram at the time.</p><p class=dh>It is essential to point out that Gomez does not follow him back on the platform (as of July 1, 2022). She also has over 330 million Instagram followers, so it is hard to tell if she even noticed Evans on her followers' list.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HINT #3: DID SELENA GOMEZ AND CHRIS EVANS VISIT THE SAME RESTAURANT?</strong></p><p class=dh>October 2021 was quite busy for "Chelena" hopefuls. A Twitter user posted photos of Gomez and Evans supposedly leaving a recording studio and a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-fans-think-chris-evans-selena-gomez-might-be-dating/>restaurant</a>.</p><p class=dh>The netizen even included photos of Selena, wearing black shorts and a matching hoodie, getting in the passenger's seat of a black SUV next to one of Evans, who put on black pants and a blue t-shirt, jumping in the backseat of a similar vehicle.</p><p class=dh>Although the tweet went viral, it was later confirmed to be a misunderstanding. Gomez's pictures date back to October 2019 and November 2017, while Evans's photos are from the summer of 2020 and October 2013.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HINT #4: ISN'T THAT CHRIS EVANS' SWEATER?</strong></p><p class=dh>Evans and Gomez's fans got another hint about their reported relationship on November 13, 2021, thanks to her best friend, Taylor Swift.</p><p class=dh>Gomez made a cameo on Swift's seven-second <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tiktok.com/@taylorswift/video/7030279636554747141>TikTok video</a> to support her appearance on "Saturday Night Live." The clip showed Gomez wearing a white cable-knit pullover sweater.</p><p class=dh>"Chelena" theorists found her sweater very similar to the one Evans wore in the 2019 film "Knives Out," starring Ana de Armas, Daniel Craig, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Jamie Lee Curtis.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HINT #5: IS THAT SELENA GOMEZ FILMING CHRIS EVANS?</strong></p><p class=dh>Shortly after Swift's TikTok video went viral, Evans added more fuel to the speculation by posting a video playing Prince's "Purple Rain" on the piano on his Instagram Stories.</p><p class=dh>A person zoomed into the clip and noticed a brunette woman filming Evans while he played the piano. Coincidentally, Gomez had just debuted her brunette bob cut on social media.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Apart from [Justin] Bieber, Gomez also had brief flings with the "Home Team" actor Taylor Lautner.</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHO IS SELENA GOMEZ DATING?</strong></p><p class=dh>Despite the multiple hints, neither Evans nor Gomez has addressed the dating rumors. One thing is clear: the Hollywood superstars have dated other celebrities throughout the years.</p><p class=dh>Gomez was in a headline-grabbing relationship with pop star Justin Bieber for almost a decade. They claimed to be just good friends until confirming their romance in February 2011.</p><p class=dh>They dated on and off, and the last time Gomez and Bieber gave love a try was in November 2017. However, they switched their relationship to the permanent "off" position in March 2018. Bieber married Hailey Baldwin.</p><p class=dh>Apart from Bieber, Gomez also had brief flings with the "Home Team" actor Taylor Lautner, Russian-German DJ and music producer Zedd, and former One Direction member Niall Horan.</p><p class=dh>In early 2021, Gomez and her "Only Murders in The Building" co-star Aaron Dominguez sparked dating rumors after photos from the Hulu series set hit the internet.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>[Evans] revealed he had a crush on Bullock when he was younger.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Unfortunately, the rumors drove some people to send Dominguez threats to stay away from Gomez on social media. The "Love You Like a Love Song" singer quickly defended Dominguez by shutting down the dating speculation. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2021-03-11/selena-gomez-revelacion-spanish-language-record>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I honestly thought, 'No wonder guys don't want to date me!' I think people only care because I'm young, and the older I get, the less they'll care."</p><p class=dh>After revealing that she didn't like that part of her job and being famous, Gomez pointed out that she was grateful for not being involved with anyone, confirming her single status.</p><p class=dh>In March 2022, Gomez's dating life <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a39309839/selena-gomez-zen-matoshi-dating-rumors-explained/>made headlines again</a> after going to Dua Lipa's show at Madison Square Garden with Los Angeles-based tech entrepreneur Zen Matoshi and her WonderMind co-founder Daniella Pierson.</p><p class=dh>Shortly after, people took to Matoshi's social media accounts to ask if he was dating Gomez. A source eventually debunked the rumors. They pointed out that Matoshi had been helping advise Gomez on tech-related topics, and they were just friends. The source added that Gomez was "happily single."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHAT ABOUT CHRIS EVANS' DATING HISTORY?</strong></p><p class=dh>The "Avengers: Endgame" actor has also dated high-profile actresses. After supposedly dating his "The Newcomers" co-star Kate Bosworth in 2000, Evans dated <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/chris-evans-complete-dating-history/>Jessica Biel</a>.</p><p class=dh>The former couple worked in two films together and even sparked engagement rumors. Biel revealed in 2005 that although they "always" talked about marriage, they were not engaged. Biel and Evans parted ways in 2006, and she married Justin Timberlake in 2012.</p><p class=dh>After leaving Biel, Evans was linked to his "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" co-star Emmy Rossum, mainly because they kissed at a Hollywood bar in 2007. Rossum later said they were just friends.</p><p class=dh>Evans briefly dated Christina Ricci, Amy Smart, and Dianna Agron before being linked to "The Lost City" star Sandra Bullock in 2014. Two years earlier, he revealed he had a crush on Bullock when he was younger.</p><p class=dh>However, Bullock used humor to address the rumors. She joked that they tied the knot but separated after their relationship began falling apart. Bullock <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/chris-evans-complete-dating-history/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"We filed for divorce, and I hope everyone can respect our privacy. But we're going to remain friends and share responsibility of the farm animals we've taken on."</p><p class=dh>Evans and Minka Kelly dated on and off between 2007 and 2015, and one year later, he got romantically involved with his "Gifted" co-star Jenny Slate. They called it quits less than a year later but reunited in November 2017, only to break up again in March 2018.</p><p class=dh>Lily James and Evans sparked dating rumors in mid-2020 after getting cozy together in London twice. They never addressed the speculations, though. <a class="me a" href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and Chris Evans might be single, but their alleged romance seems more like a wish than anything else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwa2hoa3q0scuepZpll6S6psaMnJ%2BroaNisretzaxksJ2imnqzwcyoqZ6cXZeyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./babyname.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thea - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity">&larr;
