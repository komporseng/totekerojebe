If you want to grab all the details about Harlod's personal life we suggest you read the entire article.</p><h2>The early life of Harold Ramis</h2><p>Harold Ramis was born in Chicago, Illinois, USA on <i>November 21, 1944</i>. His father is <strong>Ruth Ramis</strong> and mother <strong>Nathan Ramis</strong>. His parents owned the Ace Food & Liquor Mart on the far North Side of the city.

He graduated from Nicholas Senn High School in 1962 and then from St. Louis, Missouri, Washington University in 1966.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/8/Capture-1567913601879.jpg><p>He started off his career in 1968. Similarly, he worked as the deadpan foil of Belushi in 1972. Harold was the successor to National Lampoon's Lemmings in 1974, along with <strong>Belushi</strong>, <strong>Murray</strong>, <strong>Joe Flaherty, Christopher Guest</strong>, and <strong>Gilda Radner</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise in 2004, he got the <i>Distinguished Screenwriter Award</i> from the <i>Austin Film Festival</i> and a <i>Chicago Improv Festival</i> prize in 2010. In 2015, even after his death, he had got the <i>Laurel Award</i> for Screenwriting Achievement. Additionally, he has worked with famous Hollywood personalities like<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Bill Murray</strong></a>, <strong>Mel Brooks</strong>, <strong>Dan Aykroyd</strong>, <strong>Ivan Reitman, </strong>and many other crew members in movie <i>Ghostbusters</i>.</p><h2>Personal Life: More about his Relationship</h2><p>Moving toward the private lives of Harold Ramis, he was a married man. At 7 May 1989, Harold, the 74-year-old, tied a knot to <strong>Erica Mann</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/8/Capture%20(1)-1567913706725.jpg><p>The couple lived a very blissful life together for more than 25 years without the rumors of any split and extra-marital affairs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Past Relationship- Anne Ramis&nbsp;</h2><p>Earlier, Harold exchanged his wedding vows on 2 July 1967 with <a href=#><strong>Anne Ramis</strong></a>. But after 14 years of blissful married life, the couple filed for divorce on March 27, 1984. The reason for their split is still out of media's reach. <a href=#><strong>He also briefly dated director Amy Heckerling</strong></a> after his split with Anne. However, the pair didn't walk up to the wedding aisle.&nbsp;</p><h2>Children&nbsp;</h2><p>From his marriage with Anne, he has a daughter named <strong>Violet Stiel</strong>. He even had a daughter named <a href=#><strong>Mollie Heckerling</strong></a><strong> </strong>with his relationship with the director, <a href=#><strong>Amy Heckerling</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/8/Capture%20(2)-1567913835943.jpg><p>Harold had two daughters <strong>Julian Arthur</strong> and <strong>Daniel Hayes</strong> from his last marriage with Eric.</p><h2>Net Worth - $50 million</h2><p>Ramis was a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. He earned wealth around <strong>$50 million</strong> during his legacy. However, now his bank balance and property is possessed by his widowed wife Erica and their children. He was not only an actor but also an excellent director and producer. The other details about his endorsement and charitable works are under the shade and haven't been revealed yet. &nbsp;</p><h2>Cause of Death&nbsp;</h2><p>He had contracted an infection that caused autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis complications which eventually lost the capacity to walk. Because of this, he experienced a relapse of the disease and died of complications. The world lost one of the legends on 24 February 2014.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqGYq6ecmXqzrcyiqg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./qa-tiktok-star-nic-gonlas-on-a-crazy-2020-and-the-power-of-the-app.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Q&amp;amp;A: TikTok star Nic Gonlas on a crazy 2020 and the power of the app">&larr;
