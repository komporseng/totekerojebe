She posted a series of IG stories in Dec 2021 which we will share in this article.</p><p>This article unveils information on her net worth, age, height, and husband. Scroll down to learn more about her.</p><h3><strong>Meet Gigi Meyer, Urban Meyer’s Daughter</strong></h3><p>Urban Meyer’s tenure has come to an end but his daughter Gigi Meyer is not satisfied just yet. She recently went on her Instagram rant on her IG story in support of her father who was cut off after 13 games into his first season with the team. “The spirit of the enemy is in full force battle mode in this world & people. This is war. But like I said… We all know who wins in the end <img role=img draggable=false alt=🙏🏻 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/1f64f-1f3fb.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>&nbsp;<img role=img draggable=false alt=✝️ src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/271d.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>” The younger daughter wrote on her IG.</p><p>In another message, Gigi claimed that the enemy which she referred to as the world doesn’t wanna see good people win. She challenged that people argued whether her dad was a good person or not based on what people saw in the media.</p><p>Gigi further claimed anybody who knew her and her family was knowledgeable about how incredible of a person he was. She ended the post with, “& the world hates any platform we have, so he’s going to create chaos to destroy it. Little does he know he’s making it stronger. It’s not over. Keep watching.”</p><p>Urban was put on a hot stool because of the video of him and <a href=#>Cayman Nebraska</a> back in October 2021. While Gigi’s father was criticized and questioned about his character, she defended him. She insisted that her father was a family man and insisted his family take pictures with him because he couldn’t enjoy the moment without them.</p><p>Gigi added in a separate IG story, “Always spoke about the power of LOVE & FAMILY with his platform. Never once cared about the money he made & his fame.” She insisted on sharing that it wasn’t about people’s opinions because she didn’t care about it at all. She warned if anyone spreads lies about her family then it would be a problem.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Gigi Meyer’s Mother And Siblings?</strong></h3><p>Gigi Meyer was born to her mother Shelley Meyer who married her father in 1986. After her husband’s scandal, Shelley announced on Twitter that she was leaving the platform because of her husband’s widespread criticism of the platform. She had tweeted, “This will be my last post on Twitter. Frankly, I don’t need the hate, vitriol, slander, trash that will @ me (this has never stopped anyway.”</p><p>Gigi’s mother is a certified nurse who had a teaching position at Ohio State University. In the past, Shelley also turned heads with COVID-19 denial and with her anti-mask posts and retweeting anti-vaccine posts. She is also on Instagram and is active (@shelleymeyerspin). She recently posted on 4 December 2021 welcoming her granddaughter Savannah.</p><p>Talking about siblings, Gigi Meyer has an older sister Nicole Lynn ‘Nicki’ Meyer. Born in September 1990, Nicki played volleyball at Georgia Tech. While there, she met her husband Ohio State Buckeyes quarterbacks coach Corey Dennis. They live in Ohio and share two sons Troy and Gray. Nicki majored in Management/Communications and was one of the only thirty-three players on the Atlantic Coast to be named to the 2011 All-ACC Academic Volleyball Team.</p><p>And then there is Nicki and Gigi’s brother Nate Meyer. Nate was born in November 1998. He joined the Cincinnati Bearcats football team as a walk-on wide receiver in 2020. He also played for the University of Cincinnati’s baseball team for two seasons.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Gigi Meyer Husband?</strong></h3><p>Gigi Meyer is married to her husband Brian Pruett.</p><p>Gigi and Brian got engaged on 17 July 2018. She took to her Instagram to announce the engagement that she captioned, “So this just happened… 💍 I love you <a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@brian_pruett</a>. Can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you!”</p><p>According to the website of Bed Bath & Beyond, Gig and Brian shared their wedding vows on 8 February 2020.</p><p>Talking about Brian, he is a former Division 1 baseball player turned NASM certified physical trainer and Coach. He grew up in Sarasota, Florida and he focused on sports growing up.
