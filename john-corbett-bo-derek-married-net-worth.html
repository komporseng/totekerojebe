His first on-screen job was for a Samsung commercial from which he gained more opportunities from the entertainment business.</span></p><p><span>Recently, he was reported to have tied the knot with his nearly 20-year long partner. Know more about him here!</span></p><h2><span><strong>John Corbett Is Married To Bo Derek</strong></span></h2><p><span>John Corbett and Bo Derek intimately had their good time on the pandemic lockdown last year, as John revealed their marriage with his longtime girlfriend.</span></p><p><span>In an<a href=# rel=noopener> interview in CBS’ The Talk</a> on 3 August 2021, John talked to host Jerry O’Connell gushed about the couple’s private marriage “publicly” for the first time ever since.</span></p><p><span><span>While showing off his wedding ring during the show, h</span>e said,</span></p><p><strong><span>“Jerry, I can’t believe that I forgot to tell you that around Christmas time we got married. Bo and I got married!. And this is probably the first time, you know, we’re pretty people. We didn’t make an announcement. All our friends and family knew.”</span></strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>🚨Breaking News!🚨<br>John Corbett reveals exclusive breaking news about his relationship with Bo Derek to the hosts, including his good pal <a href=#>@MrJerryOC</a> 💍 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tP1lfjmPL7</a></p>— The Talk (@TheTalkCBS) <a href=#>August 3, 2021</a><p><span>Later on, a rep for Derek also clarified John’s statement to USA TODAY that they were<strong> “married late last year in a private ceremony.”</strong></span></p><p><span>John further explained that their marriage to be a decision they took to perform that exact year of 2020 since they “didn’t want 2020 to be that thing that everybody looks back at and hated.”</span></p><h2><span><strong>John Corbett And Bo Derek Had 20 Years Long Dating Life</strong></span></h2><p><span>John Corbett, 60, and Bo Derek, 64, first linked through John’s friend, a Hollywood agent Norby Walters back in 2002. Norby was revealed to have set him up with his now-wife Bo, which John told back in 2015 on <a href=# rel=noopener>Today</a>.</span></p><p><span>The pair started dating in 2002, after Bo’s then-husband, John Derek, passed away in 1998. John quickly got attracted to the beauty in front of him in their first meeting, and Bo also gradually opened up her heart for the actor as time went by. Eventually, nothing stopped them from getting closer to each other over time. The couple resides close to Bo’s family and enjoys their free time together every now and then.</span></p><p><span>And after all these years of dating, the couple intimately tied the knot during the pandemic lockdown in 2020. However, they were not in much spotlight when it comes to marriage since back in 2016, Corbett told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Huffington Post</a>’s Lauren Moraski that the “secret” to being together is to not “get married.”</span></p><p><span>Similarly, Derek previously told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a>:</span></p><p><strong><span>“We talk about [marriage] sometimes, but we don’t have children and we’re not young, so there isn’t that pressure or need to get married.”</span></strong></p><p><span>But, to our surprise, the couple privately arranged a ceremony for them to get married over Christmas time last year.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Do John Corbett And Bo Derek Have Any Children?</strong></span></h2><p><span>Though the couple has been together for nearly 20 years, they do not have any children. But they are still close enough to share all these years together.</span></p><p><span>The couple resides on a ranch in Santa Ynez, and once <a href=# rel=noopener>John even joked, saying</a> they<strong> “don’t have children, but we have furry ‘children’ – German shepherds and Irish wolfhounds.”</strong></span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of John Corbett</strong></span></h2><p><span>Over the decades of effort on his own professional career, John Corbett has had several successful stints to earn him great wealth for himself. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>CelebrityNetWorth</a>, he has an estimated net worth of $9.5 million.</span></p><p><span>His wife, however, has a significantly high <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> than himself, which is noted to be $40 million as per the publication. The couple also owns a ranch in Santa Ynez, which they&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>purchased</a> during the year 2017.</span></p><p><span>John started his job at a boiler-making factory after his high school graduation. After sustaining an injury, he left the factory to study hairdressing while taking acting classes in the evening. He eventually landed his first commercial appearance with Samsung and appeared on around 50 more national commercials.</span></p><p><span>His acting career began through a guest role in the 1988’s The Wonder Years. Following this, he had his career breakthrough in the 1990’s Northern Exposure&nbsp;and subsequently got his lead role seven years later in the 1997’s The Visitor.</span></p><p><span>Up until the point when he starred in the 1998’s Sex and the City, he had already been honored with numerous nominations in Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award. Saturn Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, and such.</span></p><p><span>Other of his acting credits include in the movies and TV shows like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, United States of Tara, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, Serendipity, Rebel, The Messengers, Undone, Gully, The Silence, Mata Hari, Kiss Me, Street Kings and much more.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, John is also a country singer who has released two country music albums as of now; John Corbett in 2006 and Leaving Nothin’ Behind in 2013.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46jpqGmXZi8s67Eratmmp9isaa%2BxKRkppmip7amsIynnK1lp6S%2FtbQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kristine-sloth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristine Sloth - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Career, Wiki, Facts">&larr;
