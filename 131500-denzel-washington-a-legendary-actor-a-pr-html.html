Lynne knew that she had to do something, so she placed him in the Oakland Military Academy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4bfe24ecb886ac170bf60f2331bbb310597271548880802.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Denzel Washington and his family during the 73rd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 10, 2016, in California | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih>“COME-TO-JESUS” MOMENT</h3></p><p class=dh>Thanks to his time in the academy, his faith <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://faithtap.com/7656/denzel-washington-shares-his-feelings-about-the-christian-faith/>grew stronger</a> and never faded again. There is a moment in his life, though, that could be labeled as the “come-to-Jesus” moment. It happened at his mother’s salon when a lady told him, “young man, you are going to travel the world and speak to people. You are going to preach.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7429c8fa96ffd8906341be3bf4a7298d2968141548880900.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Denzel Washington at the 23rd Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on January 29, 2017, in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>At that point, he was 20 years old and had a 1.7-grade point average, but the lady’s words “woke up” Denzel, so he started studying medicine at Fordham University. After a while, he realized being a doctor was not his vocation.</p><p><h3 class=ih>FINDING HIS VOCATION</h3></p><p class=dh>After taking a semester off, he started working at Camp Sloane YMCA in Lakeville, Connecticut as the Creative Art Director.

A while later, he got his first acting role in “Carbon Copy.” Later, he appeared in important films such as “Glory,” and “Malcolm X,” and the rest is history.</p><p class=dh>At the moment, the man is <a class="me a" href=#>married</a> to Pauletta Pearson. The couple tied the knot in 1983 and have had four children so far, John David, Katia, and twins Olivia and Malcolm.
