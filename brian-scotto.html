Who is Brian Scotto’s wife?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Brian Scotto is an American motorsports fan who became the marketing editor for Monster World Rally Team and the chief brand officer for the motorsports lifestyle brand Hoonigan.</p><p>Scotto has also been the creative mind and driving force behind all Gymkhana videos – the coolest, craziest, most viral automotive content ever put online.</p><h2><strong>Biography</strong></h2><p>He was born on December 1, 1980, in New York City, USA.</p><p>Brian lived in New York City before moving to Venice, California.</p><p>Scotto attended the University of Vermont (a public research university in Burlington that was founded in 1791) and Stony Brook University (one of 4 university centers of the State University of New York system), but, he didn’t finish any.</p><p>During an interview, he said:</p><p><strong>”I studied mechanical engineering and wasn’t really sure what I would do with that after college, so it really was a difficult period for me.”</strong></p><p>He became an automotive journalist for 0-60 Magazine. Scotto served as editor-in-chief of 0-60 Magazine for over 4 years, until December 2010.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Joey Swoll Real Name</a></p><p>In 2010, Scotto and Ken Block joined forces to create Hoonigan, a brand that has now become synonymous with the lifestyle of car fanatics worldwide.</p><p>Brian is Hoonigan’s chief creative officer. Furthermore, Scotto has been behind the camera for the duration of Gymkhana’s series.</p><p>During an interview, Brian said:</p><p><strong>”The concept for Hoonigan grew out of Ken Block and myself recognizing a void in the world of motorsports, there were no brands like DC Shoes for car guys.”</strong></p><h4><strong>Note</strong></h4><p>Ken Block is a professional race car driver who began his rallying career with the Vermont SportsCar team in 2005. In the same year, Ken was named Rally’s Rookie of the Year.</p><p>Block, together with Matt LeBlanc (actor and television host), while filming a segment for the show Top Gear, performed donuts at the Cenotaph War Memorial in London in a Ford Mustang.</p><p>Over the years, Block has competed in various action sports events, including motocross, snowboarding, and skateboarding.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Lee Priest Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>YouTube</strong></h2><p>Hoonigan’s YouTube channel was created on October 12, 2010.

But it came at a perfect time, because that was the same year – or right after the year – that Gymkhana was in X-Games.”</strong></p><p>Brian later added:</p><p><strong>”So there was all this emphasis around Gymkhana grid and the course, so the idea of doing the ultimate Gymkhana grid course came out.”</strong></p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>Brian Scotto married Ashley in September 2017.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Pascal Duvier’s wife</a>?</p><h2><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>Brian Scotto is 6 ft 8 in (203 cm) tall.</p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><p><br>”I wish we kept up more these past few years.

Now, as I approach 40, I realize they were actually living their best life.”</p><p>”So after years of protest, I guess I’m finally going to give Twitter a chance. Excuse any noob mistakes I may make.”</p><p>”Don’t ever get too big to mop the floors yourself.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Jake Ducey Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Trivia</strong></h2><p><br>Scotto served as Editor-in-Chief for three different enthusiast titles.</p><p>His “Field Trip” series has featured Jason Ellis, a former professional skateboarder and radio host who is the founding member and vocalist for the comedy rock band Taintstick.</p><p>In 2001, Jason set the Guinness World Record for the biggest drop on a skateboard in 2001.
