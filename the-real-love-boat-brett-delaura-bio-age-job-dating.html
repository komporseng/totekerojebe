And so, it introduced to viewers an appealing group of cast and hosts. Because Brett Delaura is one of them, we shall tell you all about him in this writing called ‘Brett DeLaura Bio’.</p><h3><strong>Brett DeLaura On The Real Love Boat</strong></h3><p>Viewers were first introduced to Brett Delaura during his appearance on The Real Love Boat. But just when fans took a liking to him and were hoping that he would stick around for the long haul, he departed the show during its second episode. As for the reason, the show claimed that some sort of illness had forced Brett to leave the boat. Yet, they did not offer many details as to what that sickness was.</p><p>Brett himself had not addressed his surprising departure on social media yet. So, fans were left wondering what made him that unwell. “Omg!! Unwell?? Where did Brett go? Bring him back!” one person wrote on the internet. Then some also claimed that they were mostly watching the show because of him and therefore may stop now that he has left.</p><p>Brett was so unlikely to leave so soon as he was continually hyping his journey on&nbsp;The Real Love Boat&nbsp;as of October 13 only.</p><p>Other than Brett, the Season 1 of&nbsp;The Real Love Boat&nbsp;followed 11 other contestants searching for ‘the one’ while on a Mediterranean voyage, hosts and husband-wife pair Jerry O’Connell and Rebecca Romijn, Ezra Freeman, the bartender, Matt Mitcham, the cruise director, and of course the Princess Cruises’ captain, Paolo Arrigo.</p><p>The new reality TV series is based on the 1970s sitcom of the same name. It originally aired from 1977 to 1987 and televised the romantic and funny stories of the passengers and crew who were on board the Pacific Princess.</p><p>About the new show, CBS’s CEO and President George Cheeks said in a statement that it is a timeless, romantic concept with universal appeal, and they are excited to reimagine the popular series for audiences in two different countries.</p><p>The Real Love Boat of 2022 takes place on a real cruise ship, at sea, for 21 days.</p><h3><strong>Is Brett DeLaura Dating Anyone Today?</strong></h3><p>Brett DeLaura did not seem to be dating anyone at the time of this writing.</p><p>However, on the show, he was linked with fellow contestant Brooke White. Viewers had seen them get to know each other better. The food and beverage rep, 34, was seen asking Brett, 36, many people he had slept with. To this Brett answered “Five-ish” leaving Brooke stunned. “Oh, my lord. Am I potentially dating a priest?” she had then remarked during a subsequent confessional.</p><h3><strong>Brett DeLaura Age</strong></h3><p>Brett DeLaura was born in 1985. So, she reached the age of 37 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Brett DeLaura Job</strong></h3><p>As per LinkedIn, Brett DeLaura had been working full-time as the senior sales and product line manager at footwear and branded apparel, Mitchell & Ness Nostalgia Co.&nbsp;from September 2021 until the time of this writing (2022).</p><p>Before this, the connoisseur in sports marketing briefly worked at CHARLY USA, another footwear and apparel company, and even before that, he worked at&nbsp;ASICS America Corporation for almost a decade.</p><p>Speaking of his education, Brett went to Capistrano Valley High School for his High School Diploma between 1999 and 2003.
