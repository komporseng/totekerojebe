Do they share any children together?</p><p>Scroll down for more details here.</p><h3><strong>Was Lorenzo Gordon Ever Basketball Wives Star Brittish Williams Husband?</strong></h3><p>Lorenzo Gordon and Brittish Williams were engaged to be married but never made it to the “best days of their lives.” So, no, they were never married so Lorenzo was never her husband.</p><p>The couple got engaged in 2014 after years of dating each other. But, their relationship had a problem and like many the reason for the failure of their relationship was infidelity.</p><p>Soon after, within a year of becoming engaged, the relationship issue emerged. After learning that Lorenzo had cheated on her while traveling abroad, Brittish ended their relationship on his birthday. The pair appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars in an attempt to strengthen their bond. But everything went south in their relationship.</p><p>After 2020, despite all of their attempts, they finally drifted apart. They haven’t been featured on each other’s social media for more than two years.</p><p>But, whether it is to vent the pain she feels or the relevance she sought, Brittish chose to call out her ex Lorenzo on social media. She voiced, “Public service announcement, my baby daddy is a sucker, let’s make that very clear”. She ranted further saying, “I’m not talking to you, I’m not bothering you. I changed my number almost two months ago. You can’t even contact me, what are we talking about? You don’t get your f*cking child, you don’t take care of her, you don’t send no money, you don’t do sh*t.”.</p><p>Brittish continued to say, “Don’t nobody owe you sh*t, I don’t owe you no muthf*ckin money for some sh*t you f*ckin’ bought me. Are you dumb? Who even asks for some f*ckin sh*t back?”</p><p>According to Brittish, the two have been broken up since March 2016.</p><p>The fight brought to light the details of unpaid child support, but she shared everything in a cryptic manner. So, it remains unclear what caused Brittish to go berserk on the internet.</p><p>Lorenzo responded to Brittish on his Instagram account quite quickly. He even claimed that she told him again about her current boyfriend’s purported threat to kill him in front of their daughter. In an effort to maintain harmony, he added that he hadn’t seen their child in five weeks.</p><p>He did, however, acknowledge that he made Brittish and that without him, she would not be on “Basketball Wives” and would not have been able to achieve some of her accomplishments.</p><p>After the publicized accusations, Lorenzo said, “The only thing I got a problem with is the n-gga said he’s gonna kill me in front of my child and my child repeated it to me.” He then added, “Where they do that at? How can you allow that?”</p><p>Lorenzo also threatened to release the sexual videos that seemingly started this public beef in the first place.</p><p>“Motherf-ck-rs got footage of you eating a– and everything possible,” said Lorenzo. “Footage is more than words. Remember that. You can say all you want to say, but when people see the footage, don’t say I’m eating your a– and all of that. They call you potty mouth around this motherf-ck-r.”</p><h3><strong>Do Lorenzo Gordon And Brittish Williams Have A Daughter?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Lorenzo Gordon and Brittish Williams shared a daughter named Dash Dior Gordon. Dash was born in May 2018. Hence, in May 2023, she reached 5 years old.</p><p>“You put all this energy into me and my n-gg- but you can’t call to find out if your daughter is okay,” Brittish added before accusing her ex of harassing and threatening her.</p><p>Lorenzo’s older daughter Kalese turned 19 years old in July 2023.</p><h3><strong>Lorenzo Gordon Wife</strong></h3><p>Prior to Brittish Williams, Lorenzo Gordon’s other relationship is not public yet.</p><h3><strong>Lorenzo Gordon Net Worth</strong></h3><p>According to Wealthy Genius, Lorenzo Gordon’s net worth is above $3.8 million.</p><p>American basketball player Lorenzo is renowned for his adaptability as a power forward. He began his basketball career as a player for the Oklahoma City Stars, Illinois University, and Mineral Area Community College. He stands six-foot-seven (2.01 meters) tall.</p><p>As he traveled abroad to play basketball in countries like Germany, Israel, Turkey, France, and Argentina, his basketball career changed. Playing for Ramat HaSharon in Israel and the Argentine team Obras Sanitarias is his most recent assignment.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Lorenzo Gordon From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Per FamousBirthdays, Lorenzo Gordon hailed from St Louis, Missouri.
