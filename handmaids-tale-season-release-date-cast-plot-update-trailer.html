This <a href=#>Dystopia series</a> is the creation of Bruce Mela, based on the novel The Handmaid’s Tale, written by Margaret Atwood. This fantastic American television series made its debut on 26 April 2017. Season four of The Handmaid’s Tale premiered on Hulu on April 28th.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=true>This series aired four amazing seasons, which are admired by </span><a href=#>western </a>audiences and critics. If we jumped on the series’ critical response, it was enough to get 8.72/10 ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. Its second season also got an 8.33/10 rating score, but season 3 had faced a bit of <span data-preserver-spaces=true>downfall by gaining 6.92 scores on Rotten Tomatoes. Now fans are <a href=#>waiting for its sixth installation</a> to reveal a few of the cliffhangers that have been left in the fifth season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Read below to acknowledge the upcoming season that you must know about season 6.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale</span> Renewed For Season 6?</h2><p>The Handmaid’s Tale, a <a href=#>television series</a> based on the same-named book by Margaret Atwood, will return for one last time for Season 6.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-release-date-when-will-it-air><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 6 Release Date: When will it air?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Due to the high popularity of the series, it’s not a surprise that the makers will be <a href=#>back for its sixth season</a>. The release date for The Handmaid’s Tale season 6 is expected to be announced soon, as the Hulu series is set to return in 2024. <a href=#>Season 6 of the famous series</a> will premiere in</span> mid-2024.</p><p>Filming is scheduled to commence in August 2023, and previous seasons have taken up to six months to shoot, which is where our mid-2024 estimation comes from. However, there is a possibility of filming being delayed due to the potential 2023 Writers Strike, as The Handmaid’s Tale writers have joined the picket lines.</p><p>Given that the sixth season will mark the conclusion of one of television’s finest thriller series, concluding the years-long storyline in a dramatic fashion, it is likely that the production team will be striving to release the final installment of the narrative as soon as possible for the fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-cast-who-will-be-appearing-in><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 6 Cast: Who </span>is Not Returning<span data-preserver-spaces=true>?</span></h2><p>The cast list for season 6 of The Handmaid’s Tale is expected to include Elisabeth Moss as June Osborne, Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Waterford, Madeline Brewer as Janine, Ann Dowd as Aunt Lydia, O-T Fagbenle as Luke, Max Minghella as Nick, Samira Wiley as Moira, Bradley Whitford as Commander Lawrence, and Amanda Brugel as Rita. Unfortunately, Alexis Bledel will not be returning to the show, as her character Emily was written out of the story in previous seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/handmaids-tale-season-4-cast.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-trailer><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 6 Trailer:</span></h2><p>We cannot expect a <a href=#>trailer for season 6</a> now because the filming of the new season has not yet begun. However, <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hulu has launched the trailer for season 5 before its release. Here you can watch the season 5 trailer in which you will get to see that June is still in the story as depicted to be dead in the last season.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you are still deprived of this great trailer, then you must go through it here:</span></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-plot-what-s-going-to-happen-in><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 6 Plot: What’s going to happen in?</span></h2><p>We anticipate that in season 6 of The Handmaid’s Tale, there will be further exploration of the evolving relationship between June and Nick, culminating in a climactic showdown between June and Serena.</p><p>Across multiple seasons, June and Nick’s bond has been steadily developing in a captivating manner. Moreover, season five’s conclusion hinted at the disintegration of Nick’s marriage with Rose, leaving little doubt that his feelings for June still linger. It seems unlikely that this situation will play out favorably for him.</p><p>The anticipated finale will undoubtedly deliver a powerful confrontation between June and Serena, particularly in light of June’s ruthless murder of Serena’s husband, who was also her former employer. After Serena was forced to face the gruesome sight of Fred’s mutilated body, it is highly improbable that she will be able to forgive or forget June’s actions.</p><p>The final episode of season five concludes with Nicole managing to board a train after Luke realizes that evading the police is futile and decides to turn himself in. However, an unexpected twist reveals that Serena is also on the same train as Noah. This revelation intensifies the suspense and tension.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season </span>6 Recap:</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season </span>6 Review:</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season </span>6 Rating:</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-trailer><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 5 Recap:</span></h2><p>Season 5 of The Handmaid’s Tale witnessed significant developments for the characters throughout its 10 episodes. In the beginning, a thirst for revenge consumed June, but by the end, she chose the path of moral superiority. Serena experienced what it was like to be a handmaid, while Aunt Lydia displayed unexpected tenderness towards Janine following a near-death incident.</p><p>Commander Lawrence, once an ally to June, now appears to be less trustworthy than ever before. These surprising twists and turns are setting the stage for the show’s expected final season, where fans hope to find answers to some burning questions, the most pressing being: Will June finally succeed in rescuing her daughter, Hannah, from the clutches of Gilead?</p><p>The season concluded with a train journey, symbolizing the precarious nature of the show’s narrative. Despite teetering on the edge, the final episode titled “Safe” fully encapsulated the profound connection between June (Elisabeth Moss) and Serena (Yvonne Strahovski), a bond forged through pain and animosity, which ultimately defined Season 5. The story consistently revolved around their unwavering determination, their willingness to cross boundaries, and the unimaginable suffering they endured in the name of protecting their children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-trailer><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 5 Review:</span></h2><p>Season 5 of The Handmaid’s Tale has <a href=#>garnered mixed reviews</a> from both critics and viewers. According to IGN, the show continues to delve into the consequences of a Christofascist reality, depicting its brutality with unflinching determination. However, they also acknowledge that the introduction of a new direction for June’s character brings some much-needed light to the series, albeit frequently overshadowed by equally terrible events, making the viewing experience arduous.</p><p>CNN’s review of the season emphasizes the intense animosity between June and Serena, at the expense of other narrative elements. Though the latest season consistently offers stark and shocking moments, there is a sense that it delves into segments that serve as mere filler, contributing minimally to advancing the overall plot.</p><p>Audience reviews on Rotten Tomatoes for Season 5 are divided. While some viewers express disappointment, claiming that the season introduces predictable solutions to new crises and fails to impress, others recognize the show’s potent moments of high drama and emotional intensity, despite occasional lows.</p><p>Overall, it is apparent that Season 5 of The Handmaid’s Tale has provoked a diverse range of opinions. While some appreciate its exploration of a Christofascist reality and focus on the relationship between June and Serena, others feel that the season excessively indulges in filler content and lacks substantial character development.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-trailer><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 5 Rating:</span></h2><p>Season 5 of The Handmaid’s Tale has garnered a <a href=#>mixed response from both critics and viewers</a>. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an 80% Tomatometer rating based on 31 reviews. Critics opine that the show has lost its initial impact by focusing on the consequences of vengeance, but commend the actors for their <a href=#>compelling performances</a>. The audience score on Rotten Tomatoes stands at 27% based on 500+ ratings.</p><p>IndieWire rates the season a C and notes that it still remains relevant, yet repetitive. They also highlight how the show’s dystopian themes are increasingly reflecting our current reality. Collider’s review suggests that the season is a rollercoaster ride, with intense drama and emotional scenes. They mention that certain events of the season might be distressing to watch.</p><p>In conclusion, Season 5 of The Handmaid’s Tale has garnered a mixed response, with critics and viewers expressing diverse opinions. While some appreciate the exploration of a Christofascist society and the bond between June and Serena, others feel that the season includes unnecessary filler and lacks character development.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=handmaid-s-tale-season-5-trailer>Where to Watch <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Handmaid’s Tale Season 5</span>?</h2><p>You have the option to stream season 5 of The Handmaid’s Tale <a href=#>on Hulu</a>.
